# Dynamic-Keyword-Resolver
A lightweight C# library for resolving dynamic date-related keywords in strings, designed for use cases like FTP file processing, where file names contain placeholders (e.g., NOW, YESTERDAY). The library replaces these placeholders with actual date and time values based on user-defined logic.
